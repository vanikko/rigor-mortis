RIGOR MORTIS STORY

antemortem side/leadup test game. 
rikuto-centric because hes the only character i really know how to write lol 
several endings, maybe a couple hours long (very adventurous goal but we can try)

okay so what if theres a crime and obviously rikuto went into postmortem of the dead guy only to find this hotel-sort of building (maybe a train station or something else) with other people in it 
and theyre all really passive and not aggressive which is rather strange cause 1. usually entities in postmortems are aggresive and 2. that means all of these people were in some way related to the dead guy
which shouldn't work because theyre all so unrelated and not mentioned in the person's file or history etc etc
theres several floors/stops/stations (just general checkpoints) and the main goal is to figure out whats happening and their connection to the case to figure out what happened to the victim???
